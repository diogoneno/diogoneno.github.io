  <h2 id="about-overview">Hello, I'm Diogo</h2>
  <p>
    I am a cyber security specialist with a background in site reliability and
    software engineering. My work is driven by a desire to help organisations
    design, operate, and continuously improve trustworthy systems. I enjoy
    translating complex technical ideas into practical plans that enable teams to
    move faster without compromising on security.
  </p>

  <h3>Professional Values</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Evidence-based decisions:</strong> I lean on threat intelligence,
    metrics, and feedback loops so that security choices are grounded in data.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Security is a team sport. I thrive when
    partnering with engineers, analysts, and leadership to align goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous learning:</strong> The landscape evolves quickly, so I
    invest in research, experimentation, and reflection to stay current.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
  <p>
    My recent projects have centred on secure architecture reviews, attack
    simulation, and designing developer enablement programmes. I am currently
    exploring privacy-preserving analytics and ways to embed safety controls into
    AI-assisted workflows.
