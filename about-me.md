  <h2 id="about-overview">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, I&rsquo;m Diogo. I am an MSc Cyber Security candidate at the University of
    Essex Online and an experienced Cyber Security SRE practitioner. I design and
    operate secure systems to improve team efficiency and productivity. My work
    blends practical engineering with critical evaluation and research,
    emphasising awareness and self-directed problem-solving.
  </p>

  <h3>Professional Snapshot</h3>
  <p>
    As a Site Reliability Engineer III specialising in backup and data
    protection, I provide advanced technical support, replicate complex customer
    environments, mentor peers, and collaborate with sales, engineering, and
    product teams. I am multilingual (EN, PT, ES, FR) and have a proven track
    record of enhancing knowledge base development and team enablement.
  </p>

  <h3>How I Work</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Evidence-based decisions:</strong> I rely on threat intelligence,
    telemetry, and feedback loops to ensure security decisions are data-driven.</li>
    <li>
      I collaborate with engineers and leadership to co-design controls that
      strike a balance between risk and delivery, and I prioritise continuous
      learning through research, experimentation, and reflection to maintain
      current and practical skills.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Focus Areas &amp; Strengths</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Protection, Backup &amp; Archiving:</strong> I manage enterprise
      backup (NetBackup, related appliances), lead customer case ownership, and
      conduct lab replication. I&rsquo;m skilled in diagnostics across various
      platforms, including UNIX, Linux, Windows Server, storage, networking, and
      virtualisation (VMware, Hyper-V). I have experience with Azure, AWS, and
      GCP.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Customer-Facing Engineering:</strong> I provide high-touch support for
      key customers, deliver clear written analysis, and collaborate across sales,
      engineering, and product teams to secure renewals and resolve deployment
      challenges.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>SRE-style Reliability Practice:</strong> I approach operations as an
      engineering challenge, focusing on automation, measurable outcomes, and
      continuous improvement of products and processes.
    </li>
    <li>
      I lead, mentor, and coordinate escalations, supervise multilingual queues
      (EN, PT, ES, FR, DE), coach engineers, mentor juniors, and contribute to a
      robust knowledge base.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Process &amp; Product Improvement:</strong> I document challenges,
      refine internal processes, and channel field feedback to enhance features,
      service quality, and team efficiency.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These focus areas map to CyBOK knowledge domains such as Secure Software
    Lifecycle, Security Operations &amp; Incident Management, Risk Management &amp;
    Governance, and Privacy &amp; Online Rights.
  </p>

  <h3>What I&rsquo;m Doing Now</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I am advancing my MSc by building an e-portfolio that demonstrates research,
      secure systems, and human factors with direct professional application. The
      programme&rsquo;s focus aligns with my experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      I continue to develop my skills in line with UK professional standards to
      ensure ongoing relevance and measurable growth.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What I&rsquo;m Looking For</h3>
  <p>
    I am seeking roles in security engineering and architecture, focusing on
    secure-by-default platforms, bridging technology and governance, and driving
    customer outcomes in solutions, pre-sales, TAM, or advisory. I am also
    interested in teaching and mentoring, ideally within teams that value
    evidence-based approaches, effective communication, and shared risk
    ownership.
