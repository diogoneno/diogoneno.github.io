  <h2 id="about-overview">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, I&rsquo;m Diogo. I am an MSc Cyber Security candidate at the University of
    Essex Online and an experienced Cyber Security SRE practitioner. I design and
    operate secure systems that enhance team efficiency and productivity. My
    approach integrates practical engineering with critical evaluation and
    research, demonstrating the independent judgment and problem-solving expected
    at the UK Master&rsquo;s level.
  </p>

  <h3>Professional Snapshot</h3>
  <p>
    As a Site Reliability Engineer III focused on backup and data protection, I
    deliver advanced technical support, replicate complex customer environments,
    mentor peers, and collaborate with sales, engineering, and product teams to
    achieve results. I am multilingual (EN, PT, ES, FR) with a strong track record
    in knowledge-base development and team enablement.
  </p>

  <h3>How I Work</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Evidence-based decisions:</strong> I use threat intelligence,
    telemetry, and feedback loops to ensure security decisions are data-driven.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration at speed:</strong> I partner with engineers and
    leadership to co-design controls that strike a balance between risk and
    delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous learning:</strong> I research, experiment, and reflect to
    keep my skills current and practical.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Focus Areas &amp; Strengths</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Secure architecture and developer enablement:</strong> I conduct code
    reviews and develop streamlined processes to make secure development the
    default.</li>
    <li><strong>Attack simulation and operational resilience:</strong> I lead
    exercises, from table-top to purple-team scenarios, to strengthen detection and
    response capabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy-preserving analytics and AI safety:</strong> I embed safety
    controls and governance into AI-assisted workflows.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These strengths map to CyBOK knowledge areas such as Secure Software
    Lifecycle, Security Operations &amp; Incident Management, Risk Management &amp;
    Governance, and Privacy &amp; Online Rights.
  </p>

  <h3>What I&rsquo;m Doing Now</h3>
  <p>
    I am advancing my MSc by developing an e-portfolio that demonstrates outcomes
    in research methods, secure systems, and human factors, with direct
    professional application. The programme&rsquo;s emphasis on technical depth and
    managerial perspectives aligns with my practical experience. I continue to
    develop my skills in line with UK professional standards and career pathways
    to ensure ongoing relevance and measurable growth.
  </p>

  <h3>What I&rsquo;m Looking For</h3>
  <p>
    I am seeking opportunities to lead security engineering and architecture,
    co-design secure-by-default platforms, bridge technology, governance, and
    board-level risk, and drive measurable customer outcomes in solutions,
    pre-sales, TAM, and advisory. I am also interested in teaching and mentoring
    through workshops, labs, or MSc cohort support within teams that value
    evidence, clear communication, and shared ownership of risk.
