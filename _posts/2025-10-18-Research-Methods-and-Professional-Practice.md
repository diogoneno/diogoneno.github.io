### Learning Outcomes

<ul>
  <li>Identify and explain the architecture, structure and functionality of core computer system components, relating them to cyber security concerns.</li>
  <li>Explain and apply the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) triad, articulating trade-offs and controls across people, process and technology.</li>
  <li>Recognise the competencies required of cyber security practitioners and operate within ethical and governance frameworks, including data-protection legislation.</li>
  <li>Critically evaluate vulnerabilities and threats in software and networks; prioritise risks and select proportionate mitigation strategies.</li>
  <li>Develop and document security requirements and embed them into the software development lifecycle, anticipating issues early.</li>
  <li>Apply secure object-oriented analysis and design principles; identify appropriate objects and relationships; use composition and inheritance correctly to support secure business decisions.</li>
  <li>Use UML to model system structure, data flows, storage and trust boundaries, surfacing security issues for remediation.</li>
  <li>Design conceptual and logical database models; create and manipulate data with SQL; implement security, privacy and maintenance controls at database and metadata levels.</li>
  <li>Implement basic Python programs; troubleshoot syntax and semantic errors; build scripts that accept input and persist data securely to MySQL.</li>
  <li>Use algorithmic thinking to frame problems, produce clear pseudocode, and validate solutions with suitable quality-assurance metrics.</li>
  <li>Implement and test data-protection controls and other security measures; review, harden and verify security-related code against validated requirements.</li>
  <li>Develop solutions and employ tools that efficiently identify vulnerabilities and threats in software and across networks.</li>
  <li>Assess the organisational impact of security breaches and outline appropriate incident-response considerations.</li>
  <li>Survey emerging trends and future developments in cyber security, engaging with research and evaluating implications for privacy and data confidentiality.</li>
  <li>Critically appraise the effectiveness of implemented security solutions and communicate evidence-based recommendations.</li>
</ul>

### Unit 1
<p>I learned the bigger picture of Cyber Security—what it is, why it matters to organisations, and how professionals add value. This included exploring the core CIA principles (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability), examining computing infrastructure (types of networks, software, databases, the Internet and the World Wide Web), and understanding how these components interact in information systems. I reviewed common attack types and vulnerabilities, mapped network configurations to appropriate security measures, and considered the skills and professional competencies required in the field. I also reflected on ethics and governance frameworks and how they shape responsible practice. By the end of the unit, I was able to explain the importance of cyber security, relate infrastructure components to risk, recognise prevalent threats and mitigations, and integrate ethical and governance considerations into basic threat thinking—providing a solid foundation for subsequent study and professional development.</p>

### Unit 2
<p>I learned how cyber security issues translate into legal, ethical, and governance obligations for global organisations. This included reviewing Data Protection legislation (e.g., GDPR and cross-border transfer rules), exploring regulatory and industry frameworks, and examining privacy risks with practical mitigation approaches such as privacy-by-design, data minimisation, DPIAs, lawful bases, consent management, and incident response. I applied Week 1 concepts to advise a hypothetical multinational—identifying likely ethical dilemmas and regulatory exposure across jurisdictions—and I helped turn high-level requirements into actionable guidance (records of processing, retention schedules, access controls, encryption, and vendor due diligence). By the end of the unit, I was able to recognise the key laws and frameworks, assess their implications for business operations, and produce concise, business-friendly advice that balances compliance, risk, and usability.</p>


### Unit 3
<p>I learned how to design cyber security solutions from first principles—translating threat and vulnerability analysis into concrete architecture choices. This included revisiting network foundations (peer-to-peer vs client-server, LAN vs WAN, virtual/cloud overlays) and evaluating how topology, scalability and performance shape security posture. I identified common devices and protocols (switches/routers, VLANs, IP, HTTP/HTML, SMTP/POP/FTP) and mapped them to appropriate controls (segmentation, ACLs, firewalls/WAFs, IDS/IPS, VPNs). I applied design principles such as least privilege, defence-in-depth, secure-by-design and Zero Trust, and I used structured threat-modelling approaches (e.g., STRIDE/attack trees) to prioritise mitigations. I helped turn findings into practical patterns—DMZs, micro-segmentation, hardened baselines, and secure protocol choices (TLS, SFTP/FTPS)—and linked software risks to the SDLC via secure requirements and early vulnerability identification. By the end of the unit, I was able to justify topology and control selections, evaluate trade-offs, and produce design recommendations aligned to identified threats and business goals.</p>

<section id="unit12" class="unit">
  <h3>Unit 12 — Secure Backup App</h3>

  <header aria-labelledby="secure-backup-title">
    <h4 id="secure-backup-title">Secure Backup Operation</h4>
    <p class="lead">
      This project implements a secure backup system in Python. It establishes a secure
      communication channel, verifies user credentials, encrypts data, and ensures data
      integrity during the backup process.
    </p>
  </header>

  <h5>Features</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> Uses SSL/TLS for protected data transmission.</li>
    <li><strong>Credential Verification:</strong> Validates user credentials before any backup starts.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> Encrypts backup payloads to maintain confidentiality.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity Checks:</strong> Verifies data integrity during and after transfer.</li>
  </ul>
