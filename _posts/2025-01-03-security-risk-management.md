  <h2>Security and Risk Management</h2>
  <p>
    This module introduced the fundamentals of information security and risk management, focusing on how organisations identify, analyse, and mitigate risks in response to evolving cyber threats. Analysing real-world case studies deepened my understanding of how legal, social, and ethical considerations shape professional practice and taught me to align security controls with organisational objectives (<em>Huda, 2024</em>). Collaborative and individual projects enhanced my skills in threat assessment, risk quantification, and effective communication with technical and non-technical audiences (<em>ENISA, 2023</em>).

  <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
  <p>I will be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify and analyse critical security risks, threats, and vulnerabilities in information systems (<em>ENISA, 2023</em>).</li>
    <li>Evaluate methodologies, tools, and frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, STRIDE) for mitigating business risks (<em>Deloitte, 2020</em>).</li>
    <li>Apply legal, ethical, and social principles to decision-making in information security (<em>Huda, 2024</em>).</li>
    <li>Communicate and justify risk management strategies to diverse audiences.</li>
    <li>Reflect on professional growth and continuous learning in cybersecurity (<em>Majola, 2025</em>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Artefacts and Feedback</h3>

  <p><strong>Collaborative Discussion – Legal and Ethical Issues in Cybersecurity:</strong><br>
  In this discussion, I examined the impact of data privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA, emphasising ethical responsibilities beyond compliance (<em>Huda, 2024</em>). Peers recognised the strength of my legal analysis and suggested exploring cultural and social aspects further. Their feedback broadened my ethical perspective and deepened my understanding of how regulation shapes professional conduct.</p>

  <p><strong>Team Project – Pampered Pets Risk Identification Report:</strong><br>
  As a member of Group D, I contributed to a comprehensive risk assessment for a fictional company’s digital transformation, focusing on the NIST framework and STRIDE methodology (<em>Deloitte, 2020</em>). Our report was commended for its structure but needed more detailed control recommendations. This experience highlighted the need to connect each control to measurable business value and develop mitigation strategies tailored to specific risks (<em>Christopher, 2016</em>).</p>

  <p><strong>Individual Executive Summary – Security Risk Management:</strong><br>
  This project marked a significant milestone as I integrated knowledge from previous units into a strategic report using Monte Carlo simulations for quantitative risk modelling (<em>ENISA, 2023</em>). Transitioning from qualitative to probabilistic analysis enhanced my ability to justify security investments with data-driven insights.</p>

  <p><strong>Reflective Review – Professional Growth:</strong><br>
  The reflective review allowed me to evaluate my development from a technically oriented practitioner to a strategic security professional. Tutor feedback recognised my progress in integrating ethics, analytics, and communication into a coherent professional narrative (<em>Majola, 2025</em>).</p>

  <h3>Reflections and Learning Highlights</h3>

  <p>Examining privacy laws showed that security involves not only technical systems but also people, accountability, trust, and ethical responsibility beyond compliance (<em>Huda, 2024</em>).</p>

  <p><strong>Team Project:</strong><br>
  This project reinforced the value of teamwork and effective stakeholder communication. Handling disagreements required balancing perspectives and achieving evidence-based consensus (<em>Walland and Shaw, 2020</em>).</p>

  <p><strong>Individual Executive Project:</strong><br>
  Developing quantitative risk models expanded my technical skills, while explaining Monte Carlo simulations in business terms improved executive communication and increased confidence in data-driven decision-making (<em>ENISA, 2023</em>).</p>

  <p><strong>Reflective Practice:</strong><br>
  Continuous reflection using Gibbs’ and Rolfe’s models enabled me to identify areas for improvement, adapt my learning strategies, and apply theory to professional practice (<em>Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper, 2001; The University of Edinburgh, 2024</em>).</p>

  <h3>Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan</h3>

  <h4>Skills Gained or Enhanced</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Strategic risk thinking and alignment with business goals (<em>Deloitte, 2020</em>)</li>
    <li>Quantitative analysis using probabilistic methods (<em>ENISA, 2023</em>)</li>
    <li>Threat modelling (STRIDE, attack trees) (<em>Christopher, 2016</em>)</li>
    <li>Stakeholder communication and executive reporting (<em>Walland and Shaw, 2020</em>)</li>
    <li>Ethical reasoning and legal compliance awareness (<em>Huda, 2024</em>)</li>
    <li>Teamwork and collaborative decision-making (<em>Majola, 2025</em>)</li>
    <li>Resilience planning and incident response design (<em>ENISA, 2023</em>)</li>
    <li>Reflective practice and lifelong learning (<em>Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper, 2001; The University of Edinburgh, 2024</em>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Action Plan</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Short-Term:</strong> Each week, review the latest ENISA threat reports (<em>ENISA, 2023</em>). Summarise key findings and trends in a notebook to track emerging attack vectors and assess potential impact on ongoing projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Medium-Term:</strong> Select two real business scenarios and develop risk models for each using Monte Carlo simulation (<em>Deloitte, 2020</em>). Integrate the simulation outcomes into an executive dashboard and evaluate how the results inform business decision-making.</li>
    <li><strong>Long-Term:</strong> Enrol in a CISSP or CISM certification course, schedule regular study sessions, and set a target date for exam completion within the next year to consolidate technical expertise and acquire management-level competencies (<em>Majola, 2025</em>).</li>
  </ul>

<section id="key-takeaways">
  <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
  <p>This module taught me that effective security is technical and strategic (<em>Christopher, 2016</em>). Key turning points included recognising that compliance builds trust (<em>Huda, 2024</em>), risk quantification supports informed decisions (<em>ENISA, 2023</em>), and reflection drives ongoing growth (<em>Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper, 2001</em>).</p>
  <p>This module has enabled me to approach cybersecurity with analytical rigour, ethical awareness, and strategic vision—core competencies I intend to apply in my professional practice (<em>Majola, 2025</em>). Moving forward, I am confident in leveraging these skills to drive effective security strategies, foster trust within organisations, and adapt to emerging risks through continued learning and reflection (<em>The University of Edinburgh, 2024; Walland and Shaw, 2020</em>).</p>
