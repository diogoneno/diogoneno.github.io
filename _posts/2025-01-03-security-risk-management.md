### Learning Outcomes

<ul>
  <li>Identify and analyse critically security risks, threats and vulnerabilities in information systems, accounting for the current threat landscape.</li>
  <li>Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts & warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of risks & security issues manage and audit risk & security issues.</li>
  <li>Critically determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to mitigate and/or solve security risks and their business impact.</li>
  <li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by information security and risk professionals.
</li>
  <li>Appraise the professional, legal, social, cultural and ethical issues that affect computing professionals.</li>
  <li>Appraise the principles of academic investigation, applying them to a research topic in the applicable computing field.</li>
  <li>Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic, including data analysis processes.</li>
  <li>Produce and evaluate critically the resulting research proposal for the chosen topic.</li>
</ul>


### Unit 5 
<p>I learnt about the importance of security and risk standards in both industry and enterprise contexts. This included exploring industry-specific security standards and directives, understanding how these standards influence security and risk assessments, and reviewing several common standards used across industries. By the end of the unit, I was able to identify key security standards, select the most appropriate ones for specific scenarios, and incorporate them into threat models. This comprehensive learning experience provided me with a strong foundation to effectively apply security and risk standards in various risk management and planning processes.

### Group Assignment

<p>I helped with the risk assessment for Pampered Pets' move to digital. I chose methods like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis because they help us identify and prioritise risks easily. I listed important digital projects, such as e-commerce platforms, ERP systems, and online marketing, to improve how we work. I used STRIDE to categorise risks into internal, external, or environmental and developed plans to manage them. I also created charts to show the risks clearly. This made it easier for the team and stakeholders to understand the key information. My work ensured we tackled critical risks and supported the business needs, promoting teamwork and idea-sharing.</p>

### Individual Project

<p> Unit 11, Link to <a href="https://github.com/diogoneno/diogoneno.github.io/blob/main/assets/SecurityandRiskManagement/Assignments/executivesummarysecurityRisk.pdf" title="Executive Summary">Executive Summary</a></p>

### Unit 6 vs Unit 11

<p>The final project demonstrates significant growth since the previous report, delving deeper into risk management methods. The earlier report primarily addressed fundamental aspects, such as compliance, data protection, and ensuring operational continuity.
<br>

In contrast, the final project incorporates advanced tools, including Monte Carlo simulations, to assess risks in global supply chains, automation quality, and cybersecurity.
<br>

It also outlines robust plans to manage challenges, such as real-time monitoring and disaster recovery strategies. This reflects a shift from simply addressing immediate risks to focusing on creating a resilient and adaptable framework for digital transformation, ensuring long-term sustainability and success.</p>
