  <h2 id="lics-title">Launching into Cyber Security Module</h2>

  <p>
    This module provided a strong foundation in cybersecurity concepts, architectures, and professional practice. I applied core principles, governance, and ethics to real-world controls and decision-making through practical tasks and portfolio work. I learned to translate risks into defensible security architectures and procedures aligned with organisational goals (<em>ENISA, 2023</em>; <em>NIST, 2024</em>). The focus was on measurable outcomes, clear communication, and continuous improvement through reflective practice (<em>Gibbs, 1988</em>; <em>Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper, 2001</em>).
  </p>

  <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Explain and apply foundational security principles (least privilege, defence-in-depth, secure-by-design, Zero Trust) across networks, platforms, and data flows (<em>Rose et&nbsp;al., 2020</em>; <em>NCSC, 2021</em>).</li>
    <li>Identify, analyse, and prioritise risks using structured methods (e.g., STRIDE, attack trees; qualitative through to probabilistic reasoning), and link mitigations to business goals (<em>Microsoft, 2022</em>; <em>ENISA, 2023</em>).</li>
    <li>Evaluate and select appropriate frameworks and controls when producing design recommendations and procedures (<em>ISO, 2022</em>; <em>NIST, 2024</em>).</li>
    <li>Communicate clearly with technical and non-technical stakeholders, presenting risk, trade-offs, and control efficacy in business terms (<em>NCSC, 2021</em>).</li>
    <li>Reflect systematically on practice using structured models (e.g., Gibbs; Rolfe) to inform future improvement (<em>Gibbs, 1988</em>; <em>Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper, 2001</em>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Artefacts and Feedback</h3>

  <h4>Collaborative Discussion Forum 1 (Unit&nbsp;1)</h4>
  <p>
    I gained a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity, its organisational importance, and the value professionals bring. I explored core principles, infrastructure components, and their interactions within information systems, and examined how ethics and governance shape responsible practice (<em>ISO, 2022</em>; <em>NCSC, 2021</em>). By the end of the unit, I could explain cybersecurity’s significance, relate infrastructure to risk, identify threats and mitigations, and integrate ethical considerations into threat analysis.

  </ul>

  <h4>Unit&nbsp;3 — Designing Secure Architectures</h4>
  <p>
    I learned to design cybersecurity solutions by translating threat and vulnerability analysis into architecture decisions. I revisited network fundamentals, assessed how topology and performance affect security, and mapped devices and protocols to appropriate controls. I applied key design principles and used structured threat modelling to prioritise mitigations, developing practical patterns and linking software risks to the SDLC (<em>Microsoft, 2022</em>; <em>NCSC, 2021</em>). By the end of the unit, I could justify design choices, evaluate trade-offs, and align recommendations with business goals.

  </ul>

  <h4>Unit&nbsp;9 — Individual Essay</h4>
  <p>
    I wrote a research-based essay synthesising concepts to address a specific security problem. I focused on stakeholder needs, defined the risk landscape, and justified control selection with clear criteria grounded in recognised frameworks (<em>NIST, 2024</em>; <em>ISO, 2022</em>). The essay emphasised structured analysis, transparent assumptions, and actionable recommendations to support decision-making.

  <h4>Unit&nbsp;12 — Secure Backup App</h4>
  <p><strong>Secure Backup Operation.</strong> This project delivers a secure backup system in Python. It establishes secure communication, verifies credentials, encrypts data, and maintains data integrity throughout the backup process—reflecting secure-by-design and Zero Trust-aligned principles (<em>Rose et&nbsp;al., 2020</em>).</p>

  <h5>Features</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> Uses SSL/TLS for protected data transmission.</li>
    <li><strong>Credential Verification:</strong> Validates user credentials before any backup starts.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> Encrypts backup payloads to maintain confidentiality.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity Checks:</strong> Verifies data integrity during and after transfer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Reflections and Learning Highlights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security is socio-technical.</strong> Effective security blends controls, governance, people, culture, and ethics—not merely tooling—so recommendations include ownership, accountability, and measurable objectives (<em>ISO, 2022</em>; <em>NCSC, 2021</em>).</li>
    <li><strong>From qualitative to quantitative risk.</strong> I advanced from qualitative registers to probabilistic reasoning to support investment and service-level decisions, consistent with the outcome focus in CSF&nbsp;2.0 (<em>NIST, 2024</em>).</li>
    <li><strong>Designing with threat models.</strong> Using STRIDE and attack trees improved traceability from threat → control → expected risk reduction and helped prioritise mitigations under resource constraints (<em>Microsoft, 2022</em>; <em>ENISA, 2023</em>).</li>
    <li><strong>Reflective practice.</strong> Using Gibbs’ and Rolfe’s frameworks after each artefact made iterations faster, clearer, and more evidence-based, strengthening my professional voice (<em>Gibbs, 1988</em>; <em>Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper, 2001</em>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Professional Skills Matrix and Action Plan</h3>

  <h4>Skills Gained or Strengthened</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Applied strategic risk assessment to align controls with organisational objectives (e.g., RBAC for regulated data), with effectiveness evidenced through periodic access reviews (<em>ISO, 2022</em>).</li>
    <li>Architecture and control selection (segmentation, Zero Trust patterns, secure protocol baselines) (<em>Rose et&nbsp;al., 2020</em>; <em>NCSC, 2021</em>).</li>
    <li>Quantitative analysis and evidence-based recommendations (<em>NIST, 2024</em>).</li>
    <li>Stakeholder communication and executive reporting (<em>NCSC, 2021</em>).</li>
    <li>Reflective techniques for continuous improvement (<em>Gibbs, 1988</em>; <em>Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper, 2001</em>).</li>
    <li>Threat modelling and attack tree analysis (<em>Microsoft, 2022</em>).</li>
    <li>Resilience planning and incident response design (<em>NCSC, 2021</em>).</li>
    <li>Teamwork and collaborative decision-making.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Action Plan</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Short-Term (weekly):</strong> Review current threat briefs and summarise emerging TTPs and supply-chain issues; map to my portfolio controls and note gaps (<em>ENISA, 2023</em>).</li>
    <li><strong>Medium-Term (next 6–8 weeks):</strong> Build two quantitative risk models (e.g., ransomware vs insider misuse) and present results as an executive dashboard, including assumptions, confidence intervals, and decision thresholds (<em>NIST, 2024</em>).</li>
    <li><strong>Long-Term:</strong> Pursue a CISSP or CISM certification pathway to strengthen governance and leadership and keep practice aligned with recognised standards (<em>ISO, 2022</em>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
  <p>
    Security effectiveness is measured by outcomes such as resilience, assurance, and informed decisions—not by the number of controls. I learned to articulate risk in business terms, design with explicit threat models, and communicate trade-offs transparently. I also integrated reflective practice into my work to remain adaptive, evidence-based, and ethically grounded as threats and priorities evolve (<em>NIST, 2024</em>; <em>ENISA, 2023</em>).
