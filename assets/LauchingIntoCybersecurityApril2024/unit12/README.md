Title: Secure Backup Operation



Description

This project implements a secure backup operation system using Python. It focuses on establishing a secure communication channel, verifying user credentials, encrypting data, and ensuring data integrity during the backup process.

Features

Secure Communication: Uses SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.
Credential Verification: Validates user credentials before initiating the backup.
Data Encryption: Encrypts data to maintain confidentiality.
Integrity Checks: Ensures data integrity during transmission.

How to Run


1. Install Required Libraries:

Test in Google Colab:

!pip install pytest cryptography 

or Linux machine with python-pip

pip install -r requirements.txt



2. Run the Backup Script:
Test in Google Colab with running code cell or Linux machine with

python secure_backup.py

3. Run Tests:

Test in Google Colab or Linux machine with


pytest secure_backup.py 



Code Structure
The project is implemented in a single file for simplicity:

secure_backup.py: Contains the entire implementation of the secure backup operation, including user authentication, backup management, and security features.


Security Analysis

Strengths:

Encryption ensures data confidentiality.
Integrity checks prevent data tampering.
Secure communication protects against eavesdropping.


Weaknesses:

Credential management requires strong policies.
Increased complexity may lead to maintenance challenges.
