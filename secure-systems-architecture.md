  <h2 id="architecture-overview">Module Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Secure Systems Architecture explored design patterns that embed security into
    infrastructure, applications, and operational processes. We connected threat
    modelling exercises with governance requirements and architecture trade-offs
    to build solutions that can evolve safely.

  <h3>What I Practised</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed layered reference architectures for cloud-native and legacy
    workloads.</li>
    <li>Applied modelling techniques to identify trust boundaries and prioritise
    mitigations.</li>
    <li>Aligned architecture decisions with compliance, resilience, and business
    objectives.</li>
  </ul>
