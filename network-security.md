  <h2 id="network-overview">Module Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This module focused on safeguarding modern networks, from campus-scale
    environments to hybrid cloud deployments. Through hands-on labs I analysed
    packet captures, configured secure services, and evaluated detection
    strategies across different technology stacks.

    attack surfaces.</li>
    <li>Designed monitoring dashboards that correlate logs, flow data, and IDS
    alerts for rapid incident response.</li>
    <li>Assessed wireless, remote access, and edge scenarios to propose layered
    mitigations.</li>
  </ul>
